## Description
I learned in this project that even with things that are "copy-and-paste-code" you still need to know what belongs and what does not belong. A challenge that I came across was that everything seemed to be in place and correct syntax but I had a word that snuck into the bottom of one of my javascript files that was giving me errors that did not point it out. I finally figured out that this word "Collapsed" was added by accident and everything started to work as expected. Although this took me hours to figure out it gave me the opportunity to carefully inspect the service worker code and get very fimiliar with it.

This application will allow you to track your budget online and offline. It uses *IndexedDB* to store information while offline and a *service worker* to display data offline so when switched to online it will continue with a *PUT/POST*.
